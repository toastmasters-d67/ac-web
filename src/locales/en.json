            "“New Wangdao” is a discussion of the way of leaders in organizations of various sizes. “Value creation, the balance of interests, and sustainable development” are the three core concepts of Wangdao thinking. Wangdao emphasizes looking at the total value of things through the “Six-Aspect Values.” Pay greater attention to the “intangible, indirect, future” invisible value in addition to the “tangible, direct, and present” dominant value. Build a new mechanism for mutual value creation and the balance of interests through continuous creativity and value creation. Only then can the goal of sustainable development be realized.",
            "Taiwan is already Si-nnovation. Facing the new and future challenges of the world, we need to make Taiwan the birthplace of Si-vilization. In the past, Taiwan has served as the main contributor of the world’s electronic products and material civilization. Hopefully in the future, Taiwan can contribute to the future spiritual civilization of mankind. Taiwan can position itself as a friend of the world.",
            "This year, the theme of the annual conference is “Connect to the Present, Lead the Future.” It fits perfectly with the thinking of Wangdao and its mission of leading Taiwan towards the future. Standing on the foundation of Taiwan’s current ICT and electronics industries, we can further lead future cross-domain and integration applications, develop smart medicine, cultural technology, smart agriculture, etc. We can contribute to our island, the international community, and the global environment."
